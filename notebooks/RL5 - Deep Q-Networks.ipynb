    "In the previous classes we saw that one could replace the model-based value iteration process by an approximate value iteration one. When the approximation is done by performing stochastic approximation, we obtain the $Q$ learning algorithm. We saw it was straightforward to extend this to use experience replay memories and batch stochastic gradient descent. In this class, we combine the stochastic gradient descent approach with replay memories and represent $Q$ as a neural network. This yields the Deep Q-Networks algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are few new concepts in this class compared to previous ones. Mainly, what we do is bring neural networks into the framework we have previously built. Therefore, this class is aimed at more practice. For this purpose, we start by introducing a set of [environments](#sec1) to illustrate further developments. Then we will start from Value Iteration and repeat the thought process of the previous classes, introduce [stochastic gradient descent](#sec2), [experience replay](#sec3) and reach the [DQN algorithm](#sec4). The end of the class is an [open challenge](#challenge) on several difficult benchmarks.\n",

    "> The idea that we learn by interacting with our environment is probably the first to occur to us when we think about the nature of learning. When an infant plays, waves its arms, or looks about, it has no explicit teacher, but it does have a direct sensorimotor connection to its environment. Exercising this connection produces a wealth of information about cause and effect, about the consequences of actions, and about what to do in order to achieve goals. Throughout our lives, such interactions are undoubtedly a major source of knowledge about our environment and ourselves. Whether we are learning to drive a car or to hold a conversation, we are acutely aware of how our environment responds to what we do, and we seek to influence what happens through our behavior. Learning from interaction is a foundational idea underlying nearly all theories of learning and intelligence. (Richard S. Sutton)"

That's a little too many for an efficient enumeration. Of course, most of the possible images will never occur in a Breakout game and the true state space is actually a much smaller subset of the full set of possible images. Nevertheless, unless we provide a large engineering effort in describing the state space with few variables (which would be contradictory of our goal of a \"human-level\" AI) we will need to automatically discover some structure in the state sampled data.\n",

    "To avoid confusion between the 6 actions allowed by Gym, let's build a wrapper around our environment, with only 2 possible actions (\"0\" for UP and \"1\" for DOWN) and a downscaled observation space. Unless you're curious and want to dig in the code, you can simply run the following cells and just use the resulting environment."

Why take a single gradient step on this loss when a new sample is collected? Taking several gradient steps can greatly accelerate the convergence in terms of number of collected samples. That's what is commonly called *sample efficiency*."

This can be greatly improved by taking several gradient steps on a given loss function $L_n$ instead of changing the loss function after each sample. This idea is similar to the one above.

    "A lot of contributions have built on the initial success of DQN. Among those, some are combined and discussed in the **[Rainbow: Combining Improvements in Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.02298)** paper. We will simply summarize their key ideas here, by decreasing order of importance (according to the paper).\n",
    "\n",
    "- N-step returns. Use samples that accumulate several returns rather than the 1-step return of TD(0).\n",
    "- [Prioritized experience replay](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05952). Inspired by the model-based [Prioritized Sweeping](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00993104) approach, bias the distribution used to sample mini-batches in order to present high residual samples to the optimizer. Prioritized Sweeping is designed to accelerate the convergence in $L_\\infty$ norm for tabular representations.\n",
    "- [Distributional value functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06887). Instead of estimating $\\mathbb{E}(\\sum_t \\gamma^t r_t)$, estimate the distribution of $\\sum_t \\gamma^r r_t$ and iterate on it.\n",
    "- [NoisyNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.10295). Instead of an $\\epsilon$-greedy exploration strategy, introduce noise in the network's parameters to drive the exploration.\n",
    "- [Dueling architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06581). The neural network's architecture splits $Q$ into the estimation of a value $V(s)$ and an advantage $A(s,a)$ with shared first layers.\n",
    "- [Double Q-learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06461). Q-learning is prone to over-estimation of the true optimal Q function (especially in high variance environments). Double Q-learning aims at compensating this weakness by introducing an under-estimation mechanism based on a second Q function.\n",
